# Singular Value Decomposition

We introduce the **singular value decomposition (SVD)** and give a **proof**. Next, we talk about the **application** of SVD and the **connection between SVD and eigenvalue decomposition**. Finally, we explore the **uniqueness** of SVD. [HERE](https://l-ty.com/Mathematics/Numerical-linear-algebra/Singular_Value_Decomposition) is the note.
