# Undirected Graphical Model

We introduce the undirected graph and associated Markov property. Then we talk about decomposability and the benefits of decomposability. Finally, we explore the non-decomposable model. [HERE](https://l-ty.com/Statistics/Graphical-model/Undirected_Graphical_Model) is the note.
